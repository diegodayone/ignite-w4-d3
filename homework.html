        Google for pictures

        You are creating a search engine for pictures.
        The user should be able to access your webpage and seach for some pictures.
        
        The pictures should be presented in bootstrap cards, with this layout:
        - 4 pictures per row on large screens
        - 3 pictures per row on tablets
        - 1 picture per row on smaller devices

        [EXTRA]
        - When the user clicks on a picture, remove it from the page
        - When a new search is done, the previous list should be removed

        [HINT]
        - use fetch to retrieve the pictures
        - create at runtime the elements on your container
        - use bootstrap column system to create a responsive app
        - check the response from the API! It's not giving you back and array, but an object containing an array named "images"!

        API Docs: http://www.splashbase.co/api
        Example: http://www.splashbase.co/api/v1/images/search?query=laptop

        You should change the value after "query="
